How did I go from a designer to a developer? In this post, I'll share a little bit of my story,
in the hopes that it might help you on your own journey.

## Learning Design

First, we have to go way back to 1999.

I always loved astetics and had a good eye for what I believed to be good design, but it wasn't until
high school that I learned proper visual design principles.

I was in a special class program where we learned the basics of typography, color theory, spacing and layout - the building blocks of design.

I loved the idea of making something beautiful _and_ functional. Design is based upon _principles_ that can be learned and applied. I loved that aspect of it.

## Working as a Designer

Fast forward a couple of years later, I started working as a graphic designer in a local advertising agency.
Interactive advertising was the latest rage, the glory days of Flash and I was fascinated by the idea of creating something people could interact with.
It was long hours and low pay, but I learned a LOT.

I was lucky to join a small consulting company that did print and interactive work.
Being that small meant I had to learn to code my designs. Mini sites, landing pages, emails and newsletters, I did it all.

## Becoming an Developer

I kept doing design work as my main job, but I felt something was missing.
I wanted to get a better understanding of what I'm coding, not just copy pasting snippets of `jQuery` and trying to figure our `DOM` apis.

A local college started offering a course for web development. I wanted a more formal and structured education, so I signed up.
It was an intence 10 month course where we learned the basics of web development. From `HTML` and `CSS` to `JavaScript` and `jQuery`.
`Angular v1` was the hot new framework at the time and we learned that too.

I knew making the transition from designer to developer would be tough, but I was determined.
With the help of my design manager and VP of R&D, we came up with a transition plan and I started as a full time front-end developer ðŸ’ª.

This is where the pieces began to fall into place for me. The visual aspect of the web felt like the missing link between design and development.
I found my place!

## Humble Growth

About a year into my first role as a developer, we started using `React`.
That was the turning point for me. React made sense to me. It's composability modal was a perfect fit for my design background.
It all _clicked_ for me.

This is when I started to grow as a developer.

Understanding the fundamentals led to faster adoption of the next layer of tools and libraries,
and finally to understanding and creating my own mini libraries, abstractions and APIs.

## The Present

I've now been working with `React` since 2015.
Since then I've largely been a product engineer, working in health, financial and insurace tech, at small/medium startups and large companies.

I take pride in my work and I'm always looking to improve. I bring my design thinking to the table,
and I'm always looking to learn new things and grow both as a developer and as a person.
