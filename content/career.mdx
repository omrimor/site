How did I go from a designer to a developer? In this post, I'll share my story.
First, we have to go way back to 1999.

## Learning Design

I always loved astetics and had an eye for what looked good, but it wasn't until high scholl that I learned visual design principles.
We had a special classes program where we learned about typography, color theory, and the basics of design.
I loved the idea of making something beautiful _and_ functional.

Design is based upon _principles_ that can be learned and applied. I loved that aspect of it.

## Working as a Designer

Fast forward a couple of years(ðŸ‘‹ IDF), I started working as a graphic designer in a local advertising agency.
It was long hours and low pay, but I learned a LOT.

Interactive advertising was just starting to take off, the glory days of Flash and I was fascinated by the idea of creating
something people could interact with.

I was lucky to join a small consulting company that did print and interactive work.
Being that small meant I had to learn to code my designs for landing pages and newsletters.

## Becoming an Developer

I kept doing design work as my main job, but I felt something was missing. I wanted to build things, not just design them.

A local college started offering a course for front-end web development. I wanted a more formal education, so I signed up.
It was an intence 10 month course where we learned the basics of web development.
Angular v1 was the hot new thing at the time.

I knew making the jump from designer to developer would be tough, but I was determined.
With the help of my design manager and VP of R&D, we came up with a transition plan and I started as a front-end developer.

This is where the pieces began to fall into place for me. The visual aspect of the web felt like the missing link between design and development.
I found my place!

## Humble Growth

About a year into my first full time job as a developer, we started using React.
That was the turning point for me. React made sense to me. It's composibilty mental modal was a perfect fit for my design background.
It all _clicked_ for me.

This is when I started to grow exponentially as a developer.

Understanding the fundamentals led to faster adoption of the next layer of tools and libraries,
and finally to understanding and creating my own backends and APIs.

## The Present

I've now been working with React since 2015.
Since then I've largely been a product engineer, working in health, financial and insurace tech, at both startups and large companies.

I take pride in my work and I'm always looking to improve. I bring my design background to the table, and I'm always looking to learn new things.
